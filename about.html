          <h3>Common Signs of Gaming Addiction</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Exponential Increase of Gaming Time</strong></li>
            <p>Casual play turns into hours-long sessions. The individual may lose track of time or feel compelled to keep playing.</p>
            <img class="section-img" src="assets/images/tired-gamer.avif" alt="Tired gamer" />

            <li><strong>Neglecting Prior Responsibilities</strong></li>
            <p>Tasks like studying, work, or chores are delayed or skipped. This can result in poor performance or tension at home.</p>
            <img class="section-img" src="assets/images/neglecting-prior responsibilities.avif" alt="Neglecting responsibilities" />

            <li><strong>Withdrawal Symptoms When Not Playing</strong></li>
            <p>Some experience irritability, anxiety, or restlessness when they are unable to game.</p>

            <li><strong>Loss of Interest in Other Hobbies</strong></li>
            <p>Activities that once brought joy—like spending time with friends, engaging in hobbies, or enjoying outdoor activities—can start to feel dull, unfulfilling, or even burdensome in comparison to the excitement and instant gratification of gaming. </p>

          <h3>Why Does It Happen?</h3>
          <p>
            Recognizing the problem is the first sign of strength—and change is possible. Gaming addiction can feel isolating, but you’re not alone in facing it. At Game-Xit, we believe recovery doesn’t start with judgment—it starts with understanding, compassion, and small, consistent steps toward a healthier life.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/images/helping-hand.jpg">
          
          <p>
            We provide access to helpful resources including <a href="https://psychology-tools.com/test/excessive-gaming-screening-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="(Opens the self-assessing Excessive Gaming Screening Tool (EGST) in a new tab)">self-assessment tools</a>, articles on healthy habits, and professional referrals to therapists who specialize in gaming-related issues.
          </p>
          <p>For many, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective method to identify thought patterns and triggers associated with excessive gaming. Others may benefit from joining a support group, where shared experiences can help build resilience and reduce feelings of shame or guilt.</p>it
          <img src="assets/images/happy-gamer-recovery.jpg">
          <p>Creating structure can also be a powerful tool. Setting boundaries around screen time, reintroducing offline hobbies, improving sleep, and re-establishing social connections all contribute to a stronger foundation for long-term change. Even small lifestyle adjustments—like regular exercise or limiting gaming to certain hours—can lead to a noticeable shift in how you feel day-to-day.</p>
          <p>Recovery isn’t about quitting games entirely unless that’s what’s needed—it’s about finding balance, regaining control, and reconnecting with real-world priorities. If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure where to start, our team is here to listen. Visit our contact page to speak confidentially with someone who understands. A balanced, healthier future is within reach—and you don’t have to walk that path alone.</p>
